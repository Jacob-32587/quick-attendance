A mobile app for taking attendance!

## Getting Started

You will need the VS Code extension "Flutter" in order to have intellisense for development.

You will also need to install a Flutter SDK from their website.
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
Click the platform you'll be developing on.
Click Android, then scroll down to "Install the Flutter SDK" and click the "Download and install" tab. There should be button that appears below to download the zip file. This download may take awhile, so make sure you have a good internet connection. Choose a good download location that you won't forget. Maybe make a Flutter folder in your C: drive.

After downloading, extract the contents of the zip file. Next, open VS code and press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette. Search "Change SDK" and an option for Flutter should pop-up if you have the extension installed. Activate that command, then press auto-detect SDK. It should find your SDK at the location you extracted it.

Next, open the command palette again and search for "Add Flutter SDK to PATH", and execute it.

If all of this succeeds, you may have to restart VS code in order for the `flutter` command to be recognized in the integrated terminal.

Navigate to `client` in the repo and run `flutter run` to get launch options.
